I tried to make the classical variation work, but I felt like white was better in every line. The Alekhine-Chatard is pretty fun for black though.

\newchessgame
\mainline{1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 dxe4}

\chessboard[showmover=false,labelleft=false,labelright=false,labeltop=false,labelbottom=false]

\variation{5. f3? Bb4! 6. fxe4 h6 7. Bxf6 Qxf6 8. Nf3 c5!} and black is better

\mainline{5. Nxe4 Nbd7}

White has many options. I will start with only Nf3, but
 if I find some alternative to be difficult I will add it.

\mainline{6. Nf3 h6}

\subsection{7. Nxf6+}
Almost exclusively played in the master database.

\subsection{7. Bxf6}
The most popular move in the lichess player database

\subsection{7. Bh4 Be7}
\newchessgame[setfen={r1bqk2r/pppnbpp1/4pn1p/8/3PN2B/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8}, mover=w, moveid=8w]

Still a popular move.

\mainline{8. Nxf6+ Bxf6}

If \variation{9. Bg3} then \variation{9...c5} is fine for black

\mainline{9. Bxf6 Qxf6}

\variation{10. Bd3 c5} Black has no issues

\mainline{10. Qd2 O-O 11. O-O-O e5}
Black would like to play Bf5 and be equal. White has a bit more activity in the ending,
