\section{Advance French}
Black has many good options against the Advance. There are many possible plans, but I think only three of them are serious. Namely, the line with Qb6 \& c4, the line with Qb6 \& Nh6, and the line with Bd7 \& Nge7.
I never felt that Bd7 \& Nge7 was very harmonious, as it always involved am oddly timed f6. Qb6 \& c4 is more normal, but leads to very closed positions where both sides struggle to make progress.
Qb6 \& Nh6 leads to active and open positions, and I like it.
